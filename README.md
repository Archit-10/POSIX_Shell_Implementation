<h1>POSIX Shell Implementation üöÄ</h1>

<p>Welcome to my <strong>Custom POSIX Shell</strong> project! This shell isn‚Äôt just another terminal interface ‚Äì it‚Äôs built from the ground up, designed to explore the nuances of system calls, error handling, and command-line operations with features that aim to enhance both utility and user experience. Whether you're exploring directory paths or handling process control, this shell has you covered!</p>

<h2><strong>Key Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>History:</strong> Keeps track of previously executed commands for easy retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Autocompletion:</strong> Suggests commands and file paths to improve user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Signals:</strong> Handles system signals for effective process management.</li>
    <li><strong>pinfo:</strong> Displays information about running processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Background and Foreground Execution:</strong> Supports executing commands in both modes with and without arguments.</li>
    <li><strong>Pipeline:</strong> Allows chaining commands, passing output from one as input to another.</li>
    <li><strong>Redirection:</strong> Supports input and output redirection with pipeline functionality.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Technical Highlights ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Low-Level System Calls</strong>: Implements direct POSIX-compliant system calls like <code>getcwd</code>, <code>chdir</code>, and others, simulating native shell behaviors.</li>
  <li><strong>Error Handling and Validation</strong>: Every function call is designed with extensive error handling, ensuring robust operation even under unexpected conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Utilizes efficient memory handling practices to ensure low overhead for better performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Built With üñ•Ô∏è</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>C++</strong>: Core logic and system interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>POSIX APIs</strong>: For seamless, UNIX-compatible system call handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control</strong>: Managed using Git and organized for seamless collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why This Shell? ‚ú®</h3>

<p>This project showcases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>System Proficiency</strong>: Demonstrates in-depth understanding of system-level programming.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Awareness</strong>: Minimalistic exposure of system data, keeping it secure and user-centric.</li>
  <li><strong>Modular Design</strong>: Easily extensible and organized for readability and adaptability.</li>
</ul>
